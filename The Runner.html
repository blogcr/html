Betty's doctor told her to exercise more. So she began running. 
<p />She enjoys running. She runs almost every day. She runs two miles a day. On the weekend she runs five miles. 
<p />She runs up hills. She runs down hills. She runs in the street and on the sidewalk. She runs on trails. She runs in the heat and the cold. She runs on sunny days and rainy days.
<p />Betty will run in the marathon next week. Next week will be her first marathon. A marathon is 26 miles. She will run for three hours without stopping.
<p />She won't try to win the marathon. She will try to finish it.
