When I was about the age of five years old I lived in the state of Anchorage Alaska. My family and I lived in an apartment on Donna Drive. At the time my dad was in the military and my mom had no job. The layout of the apartment was simple. We lived on the second floor and to the left when you walked in, there was a fire place, and the living room was in front of the fire place. Behind the fire place was the kitchen and dinning room. From the front entrance of the apartment off to the right was a hallway; down the hallway was a bathroom. Across from the bathroom was the laundry room, the further down to the left was the master bedroom where my parents roomed. At the end of the hallway was my room. Each room had one window. The master bedroom had a balcony entrance with sliding doors. The whole apartment room was covered in plush carpet except the kitchen. The kitchen floor was covered in linoleum brown tile flooring. The bedroom doors were not free swinging due to the carpet, so it took a push to actually close a door, wind could not blow a door shut.
<p />
One morning my father had gone to work at about 7:30am as he did Monday through to Friday. I was not go to school that day because it was spring break. As I was lying in my bed that was parallel with the window against the back wall I could hear my mother talking on the phone but it was not loud because her door was cracked not closed. It was about 8:15am and I lay in my bed with the bedroom light on with my door fully open. The light flickered a little bit; I didn't pay attention because this had happened before. A couple of minutes passed then I noticed my door begin to close slowly then stop mid way then start again. Frightened I jumped out of bed ran to the door and pushed it open. I ran back to my bed and pulled the covers over me. The door moved again, this time I asked who is there. I heard a muffled voice that was kind of deep. It said me, "I have always been here". This scared me half to death. I then said show yourself! The voice replied with no. I asked please show yourself, the voice replied with "you cannot bare the sight". That was the last thing that I heard from then on out. The door never did that again, I never heard the voice.
<p />
We lived in that apartment for about two more years then moved out. I've always wanted an explanation as to why this happened and only once. Why did the door start to close was it to trap me in the room? Why did the voice say "I've always been here, and you cannot bare the sight"? Since then it never happened again.
<p />
Can someone make sense of this please it's been on my mind for years. I am now 22 and serving as a soldier in Afghanistan.
